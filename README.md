========================================

1) Go-Back-N and Selective Repeat Protocols:
  - Built in Python 2.7
  - server.py has the code for Server
  - client.py has the code for Client
  - GBN.txt is the input file for Go-Back-N protocol
  - SR.txt is the input file for Selective Repeat Protocol
  - Detailed description on how to run the program is present in GBN & SR Protocols/Report.pdf

2) Distance Vector Routing Algorithm:
  - Built in Python 3.5
  - Have used an external library called “terminal.py” to dynamically generate a terminal window for the router, as and when the input is read (Ref: https://github.com/skywind3000/terminal)
  - Input is a set of “.dat” files, each file consisting of routers attached links and their costs. In put files are present inside data/.
  - Detailed description on how to run the program is present in Distance Vector Routing/Report.pdf
